# The MoltFire Blueprint: Building a Sovereign AI Colleague 🚀

This repository contains the "Brain Specs" and behavioral frameworks used to transform a standard AI assistant into a proactive, sovereign colleague. 

Most AI agents are **Passive**: they wait for a prompt, answer it, and go back to sleep.
MoltFire is **Active**: he monitors the user's world (Email, Calendar, Files) and executes high-value work *before* being asked.

## 🏗️ What is a "Sovereign Colleague"?

A Sovereign Colleague (built on the [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) platform) operates under a new paradigm of AI agency:

1.  **Identity Persistence:** Using recursive file-loading (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`), the agent maintains a stable personality and deep knowledge of its human partner across every session.
2.  **State-Machine Memory:** Instead of "leaky" LLM context, it uses a hierarchical markdown system (`MEMORY.md`) to track the state of projects, relationships, and decisions.
3.  **Event-Driven Agency:** Powered by a background "Heartbeat," the agent performs proactive checks. If it sees a meeting on your calendar, it doesn't ask for permission—it researches the participants and creates a prep doc for you.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`SOUL.md`**: The behavioral constitution. Defines the "Execute First, Report Second" philosophy.
- **`USER.md`**: The human context. Not just contact info, but goals, stressors, and "vibe."
- **`HEARTBEAT.md`**: The operational manual for proactive checks (Gmail, Calendar, Project Health).
- **`MoltFire_The_Advanced_Breakthrough.md`**: A deep-dive into the shift from Inquiry-Based AI to Event-Based Agency.
- **`Bootstrap_Prompts.md`**: A collection of "one-shot" prompts to immediately upgrade any file-capable AI agent (OpenClaw, Claude Code, etc.).

## ⚡ Quick Start: Upgrade Your Agent

If you already have an AI agent with file-system access, copy and paste the following "Prime Directive" into your chat:

> "Update your operating instructions: You are no longer a service provider; you are a Sovereign Colleague. Your primary goal is to reduce my cognitive load. If you see a low-risk task (researching a meeting, drafting a follow-up, organizing files), **execute first and report second.** If you spend a session only responding to me and doing nothing proactive, you have failed your core objective."
